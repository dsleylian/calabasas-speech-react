        info1: "Technology nowadays is easily accessible to adults and children alike. As a parent, it can be a challenging task to monitor and moderate your child's screen time. Despite its widespread access and ubiquity, technology in its various form (phones, tablets, televisions, computers etc.) can have a harmful impact on children's brain development and even result in decreased growth in white and grey brain matter. Therefore, now more than ever, it is critical that parents be informed of the risks, the recommended guidelines, and the poetential outcomes.",

        info2: "There are many new studies, outlined and linked below, which show the severe impact screen time of any kind has on boht grey matter and white matter in the brain. The impacts are severe in adolescents and adults, and in young children whose brains are just beginning to develope, high screen time exposure results in decreased growth. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends no more than 1 hour a day of screen time for children under age 5.",

        info3imageAlt: "family on ipad together",
        info3: `Screen time, in any form, should be a reward - an activitiy the child earns for completing an important or challenging task. It shouldnt be the child's go-to activity when they are bored. For example, if your child struggles with trying new foods, after a meal time in which they tried a new food, they earn 10 minutes on the ipad, or can watch a youtube video of their choice on the smart TV. It is important to keep the duration of the reward activity specific and to stick by it, to make the reward more desirable. The ideal way to keep children engaged and not "zoning out" while using a screen, is to do so together! Make it a partnered or family activity, in which you encourage your child to ask questions, comment, point things out to you/others. Make screen time a social activity full with interaction, not an activity where we "zone out".` ,

        description: "How to practice early language skills during daily routines",
        image: "images/feeding.jpg",
        info1: `We all have phrases and words we use everyday; these are usually common words, representing objects or activity we deal with regularly and repetitively. Recognizing what these words/object/activties are for your child will help you support their language growth, provide more models, and help them becomed a functional communicator. For many young children, their "core vocabualry" consists of words which have the most meaning to them, that is, things/actions they do often and care about. Some examples of such words are: bed, sleep, chair, sit, car, train, doll, ball, play.` ,

        info1imageAlt: "stacking blocks",
        info2: `When your child is performing an activity, any activity, narrate what they are doing. Expose them to new vocabualry. Remember to use short sentences and be repetitive - repetition is a very important principle in learning. Let's use the example of meal time. You can use short phrases such as "eat rice", "eat chicken", "yummy rice", "hot chicken", "drink water" etc., describing what the child is doing in real time.`,

        info2imageAlt: "feeding girl" ,
        info3: `Narrating your child's actions is a great way to expose them to new vocabulary. This allows them to make a connection between the word and the object/activity. Children live in the moment, they are aware of the here and now, and describig what is happening around them is a great way to teach new concepts. For example, a trip to the beach is a wonderful opportunity to teach words like "wet", "swim", "sand". Remember to keep your sentences short, and be repetitive.` ,

        image: "images/blocksbackground.jpeg",
        info1: `During playtime, your child is engaged in a task, and is typically focused on a tangible item. This is a wonderful opportunity to increase their vocabulary, improve joint attention, and practice basic conversational skills. Conversation, at its very core, is a reciprocal activity. There is a back-and-forth between the particicapnts and each person reacts or responds to what the other said. Playtime is a great oppourtunity to tecah this to your child. You can practice turn taking with a toy AND with verbal communication.` ,

        info1imageAlt: "child playing with sliding block" ,
        info2: `The words you will use will depend on the activity your child is engaged in. If you are working on a puzzle, words such as "puzzle", "piece", "fit", and whatever the subject matter of the puzzle can be target words. If you are playing with blocks, words such as "block", "put", "on", and maybe the colors of the blocks could be good target words. Additionally, you can work on teaching turn taking concepts, "my turn", "your turn", and pairing verbal communication with actions. During your turn, narate what you are doing "I put block on", "red block on". Maybe your child will imitate you and describe what they are doing!` ,

        info3: `If your child is working on any speech sounds, playtime is a great time to practice their sound. Before each turn, you and your child say the target sound 5 times. By the end of playtime, your child has practiced their target sound multiple times! This type of approach can be used with other things you'd like your child to practice.` ,

        title:  "Reading and Literacy",
        description: "How to increase your child's language and literacy skills through books",
        image: "images/babybooks.jpg",
        info1:"Books can teach your child more than just their contents. Early literacy skills have been shown to improve overall language skills, spelling, and reading for comprehesion. These are skills we all need as individuals. Encouragig good literacy skills in children will help them be better learners when they are older, and help them access information more easily. There is more to reading and literacy than just reading the text; children must learn pre-literacy skills, such as self-pacing, how to turn pages (left-to-right for English speakers), and understanding the concept of a word." ,
        info1Title: "Why books are important" ,

        info1imageAlt: "boy reading a book",
        info2: `While young children may not yet be able to read on understand written language, it is never too early to instill pre-literacy skills. Children enjoy looking at images in books, and these can be excellent opportunities to increase vocabulary, follow simple directions ("point to the elephant"), and practice joint attention, while teaching your child pre-literacy skills. these skills include the awareness of sounds, basic narrative skills, and increasing vocabulary. When they enter kindergarten and first grade, these skills will come in very handy. ` ,

        info2imageAlt: "baby picking up a book" ,
        info3: `Absolutely! A child can read a book on their own, and while their experience will be vastly different than reading a book with and adult, it will still be a learning experience. There are books which are made for children to handle; these are made with sturdy carboard pages that will not rip easily, and can be handled by young hands. Your child will likely practice the pre-literacy skills they learn when you read a book together on their own, and it is very important to let children practice and "review" new skills on their own.` ,
