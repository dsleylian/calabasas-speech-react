## About this Project 

Calabasas Speech is a website for a made-up speech and language clinic. The website includes information about the clinic's approach to speech and language therapy, their staff and their specialties, as well as some free resources. I am a licensed Speech Language Pathologist, and therefore, the content and information in the Free Resources page is accurate - feel free to read through and use it!
